# Sign Up Project - [view live](https://darkwool.github.io/signup-form/)

Project made for The Odin Project curriculum, for this one we have been given a design file and our task was to replicate it, although we were told to change some things if we wanted to.

## Specifications
1. Set up and planning
    1. Download a full-resolution copy of [the design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png), and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

1. Gather Assets
    1. The design has a large background-image, so go find and download an image you want to use for that section. Be sure to credit the creator of your image!
    1. Pick an external font for the ‘logo’ section. You can use any font you like.
    1. For the image-sidebar, we’ve used this Odin logo. Again, feel free to replace it.
    
1. Some Tips!
    1. How you attack this project is mostly up to you, but it is wise to begin by scaffolding out the structure of the page, and then take the various sections one by one.
    1. The area behind the “ODIN” logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color. This enhances the readability of the text against the busy background image.
    1. The inputs, by default have a very light border `#E5E7EB`, but we’ve included 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.
    1. The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the `:focus` pseudo-class you’ve learned about in an earlier lesson.
    1. Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile, but DO resize your browser a little bit to make sure that it’s not completely broken at different desktop resolutions.
